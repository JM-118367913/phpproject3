        <h3 style=" text-align:center">Blockchain</h3>
        <pre style="font-size:162%; text-align:center">
       Blockchain is an increasingly popular technology due to the emergence 
       of crypto-currency. As its name suggests,it's a sequence of blocks or groups 
       of transactions that are chained together and distributed among the users.
       It can be programmed to record financial transactions. These records don't 
       have any reliance on external authorities to ensure the integrity of the 
       information that has been stored/recorded. Blockchain uses Hash functions 
       which provide unique output code for input. This unique code is used to 
       link blocks. As a result in the event of an attack, if one identifier is 
       interfered with, it changes in all the blocks it is linked to and the chain
       can be made invalid due to the disruption. Furthermore, users need to meet 
       an agreement about the validity of the chain before adding more blocks. 
       Every time a node adds a new block, all the users have to validate the block
       by using a common protocol. Every user has its own copy of the Blockchain, and 
       they share any update with the other users. This means there is no central copy
       of the information, but rather a similar copy is possessed by all users which 
       again prevents alteration for the information. Miners are also a valuable 
       component of Blockchain, as they come up with solutions for ensuring codes
       are restricted and unique. Blockchain is certainly a reliable and secure
       system for recording any kind of transaction or information.

            <pre style="font-size:162%; text-align:center">
       Autonomous things are things that work autonomously without human 
       guidance or direct intervention. Examples include autonomous drones and 
       self-driving vehicles. use AI to automate functions previously performed 
       by humans. Their automation goes beyond the automation provided by rigid 
       programming models and they exploit AI to deliver advanced behaviors that 
       interact more naturally with their surroundings and with people.

            <pre style="font-size:162%; text-align:center">
       Immersion enhances everyday experiences, making them 
       more realistic, engaging, and satisfying on all modern devices. A full
       quality immersion consists of 3 key ingredients: Visual quality, sound quality  
       intuitive interactions. It is essentially the  perception of being physically 
       present in a non-physical world.
